Name
Automated Indeed Job Applications

Description
The user is prompted for an indeed job listing URL. 
When provided, the program web-scrapes the indeed job application
to get the company name, position name, and keywords that match the 
technical_expertise csv. The program then copys the .template folder with 
named the company name and auto creates a proper cover letter and resume
relevant to the listing. It is then up to the user to submit the 
automated documents to the indeed job application. The program saves 
valuable time when doing many applications at once.

Notes
The user should change the provided resume to their own resume,
however the __spot__ locations on the resume are required for
the application to work. To change which technical expertise will
show up, update the items in the technical_expertise csv file
to your own expertise items in order of most relevant to lest.
